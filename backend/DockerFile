# Install Composer (the PHP package manager)
COPY --from=composer:latest /usr/bin/composer /usr/bin/composer

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /var/www/html

# Copy composer files and install dependencies
# This is done first to cache the vendor folder for faster builds
COPY composer.json composer.lock ./

# --- THIS IS THE FIRST FIX ---
# Install dependencies WITHOUT running scripts (since artisan doesn't exist yet)
RUN composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader --no-scripts

# Copy the rest of the application code (now 'artisan' exists)
COPY . .

# --- THIS IS THE SECOND FIX ---
# Now, run 'artisan optimize'. This caches everything AND
# runs the 'package:discover' script that failed before.
RUN php artisan optimize

# Expose the port. Render will use the $PORT variable.
EXPOSE 8000
